-- Suppose you have an Employees table that, among other columns, has an EmployeeID column and a ManagerID column. 

-- Self-Join:
-- If you want to list down all employees with their respective managers, you can use a self-join:
SELECT e1.EmployeeName AS Employee, 
       e2.EmployeeName AS Manager
FROM Employees e1
LEFT JOIN Employees e2 ON e1.ManagerID = e2.EmployeeID
ORDER BY e2.EmployeeName, e1.EmployeeName;

-- In the self-join query:
-- e1 and e2 are aliases for the Employees table.
-- We are joining e1 with e2 on the ManagerID of e1 and the EmployeeID of e2.
-- The result displays the name of each employee with their respective manager.
